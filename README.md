# alfresco_http_activiti_client
This Project contains a custom extension amp module which allows APS processes to be called from ACS application. The module adds 2 javascript root objects within ACS. 
This is an customised verion of the same client made available by Rui Fernandes in the Alfresco Community- The addition done here is to allow multiple documents to be uploaded onto a single form field within an APS process. The previous implementation allowed one to one mapping between uploaded document and APS form field. i.e. as many form fields would be required to upload corresponding number of documents.
